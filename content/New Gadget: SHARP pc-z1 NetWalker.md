Slug: New Gadget: SHARP pc-z1 NetWalker 


Recently, I just bought a new <a href="http://www.sharp.co.jp/netwalker/pcz1j/index.html">SHARP pc-z1 NetWalker</a>, a palm-size mini netbook. Before I decided, iPad (48,000 yen) was also interesting to me. But, the main reason I chose this gadget (34,000 yen) was because it runs Ubuntu 9.04! The followings are what I noticed after playing with it for 2 days.
<ul>
	<li>Its optical point feature (a little nail-size button used to move mouse pointer) does not work with my finger as my hand normally has some sweat. This is just a personal issue. Anyway, I can move the mouse pointer by touching the screen.</li>
	<li>The specification says it has 512 MB of RAM. The Ubuntu task monitor sees it 471.4 MB.</li>
	<li>The specification says it has 4 GB of flash-memory space. Ubuntu can see 3.6 GB.</li>
	<li>Suspending does consume some battery.</li>
	<li>The screen size (5 inches) is a bit small but acceptable.</li>
	<li>Since I bought a black model, I can see my own fingerprints when I touch it. White one should be fine in this case.</li>
</ul>
Regardless of those listed, I am satisfied with it. I am now using it as an ebook reader when I am in the train. The next target would be iPad. But, I will have to wait until the price drops down first.
